# Emotion
This software recognizes human faces and their corresponding emotions from a video or webcam feed. Powered by OpenCV and Deep Learning.


## Deep Learning Model

The model used is from this "Real-time Convolutional Neural Networks for
 Emotion and Gender Classification" [research paper] written by Octavio Arriaga, Paul G. Pl√∂ger, and Matias Valdenegro.
